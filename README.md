# **Clustering for Wheat Seeds**

### Seed clusters data

The [data](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13105-9_2) which is used is comprised of 3 different wheat seeds (Kama, Rosa, and Canadian), using high quality visualizations via soft X-ray technoques. It is inexpensive and cheaper than more sophisticated imaging techniques, and were recorded on 12X18 KODAK plates. 

Using Clustering mechanics allows the wheat seeds to be grouped and have its features examined and measured as well as distinguishing which seeds belong is which group or classification.
